# EndosoFlow — State Machines & Permissions Spec

## 1. How to read this document

This spec turns the confirmed business rules into precise state machines, SLA rules and a role × action permission matrix. It is the input to the Phase 1 requirements catalog and to data modeling (1B). No schema or code is implied.

**Two definitions used throughout**

- **Current task**: the single `in_progress` task of a sale; if none is `in_progress`, the next eligible task (the lowest-numbered task that is not completed).
- **Eligible task**: a `pending` task whose previous task is `completed` (Task 1 is eligible from sale creation). The moment a task becomes eligible is recorded as `eligible_at`.

## 2. Task state machine

### 2.1 Valid shapes of a sale's tasks

Because progression is strictly linear, the 13 tasks of an `active` sale are always in exactly one of these shapes, where k is the number of completed tasks (0 to 13):

- Tasks 1..k are `completed`, task k+1 is `pending` and eligible (waiting to be started), tasks after that are `pending`.
- Tasks 1..k are `completed`, task k+1 is `in_progress`, tasks after that are `pending`.

No other combination is valid. This gives the backend and the database one simple invariant to enforce: **completed tasks form a prefix, at most one task is `in_progress`, and it is always task k+1.** Every transition below must preserve it, inside a single database transaction.

### 2.2 Transitions

| #   | Transition                                | Who                              | Preconditions                                                                                                                                                                                   | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Reason required       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| T1  | `pending` → `in_progress` (start)         | Assigned Advisor, Manager, Admin | Sale is `active`; task is eligible; no task is `in_progress`; confirmation shown                                                                                                                | `started_at` = now; `due_date` = `started_at` + duration (only tasks with a duration); fields and uploads enabled; reminder state reset when this is a fresh start after a restart                                                                                                                | No                    |
| T2  | `in_progress` → `completed` (complete)    | Assigned Advisor, Manager, Admin | All mandatory fields and documents valid; task-specific rules pass; confirmation shown                                                                                                          | `completed_at` = now; `completion_phase` computed from timestamps; next task gets `eligible_at` = `completed_at`; SLA reminders stop; milestone notification queued if the task triggers one; if this is Task 13, the sale becomes `completed` in the same transaction                            | No                    |
| T3  | `completed` → `in_progress` (reopen task) | Manager, Admin                   | Task is the highest-numbered completed task **and** no task is `in_progress`; if the sale is `completed`, only Task 13 can be reopened and the sale returns to `active` in the same transaction | Original `due_date` preserved; `completed_at` and `completion_phase` cleared (history stays in the audit log); reminder counters kept (cap not re-armed); fields editable again; the task's customer-visible data is hidden until it is completed again; the following task is no longer eligible | Yes + audit           |
| T4  | `in_progress` → `pending` (restart)       | Manager, Admin                   | Task is the current `in_progress` task                                                                                                                                                          | Entered data and uploaded files are **kept, read-only**; `started_at` and `due_date` cleared; SLA timer discarded; reminder counters and phase reset; the task stays eligible; the next start (T1) calculates a fresh `due_date`                                                                  | Yes + audit           |
| T5  | Edit a completed task (no status change)  | Manager, Admin                   | Task is `completed`; financial source fields are editable only while **no downstream task is completed**                                                                                        | Fields or documents changed; append-only audit event with before/after summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Yes (Reason for Edit) |

Advisors can edit only the current `in_progress` task of their own assigned sales. Completed tasks are read-only for them.

### 2.3 Completion rules per task (summary)

- Every field and document is mandatory unless marked optional in the master prompt (Task 13's Surquillo transfer date; Task 2's _Vigencia de Poder_ is required only when the snapshotted `customer_type` is not _Diplomático_; the Task 4 Mismatch Reason is required only when amounts differ).
- Task 1: quoted final price = initial Toyota amount + initial commission + accessory amount + release processing amount. All four amounts are strictly positive.
- Task 3: final commission = Task 1 quoted price − final Toyota amount − Task 1 accessory amount − Task 1 release processing amount. It must be strictly positive; the final Toyota amount must also be strictly positive. Series and VIN must be unique among `active` and `completed` sales.
- Task 4: deposited amount must equal Task 1's quoted price exactly, otherwise a Mismatch Reason is required (exact match, single deposit, USD only). Bank + transaction number unique within the Task 4 space.
- Task 5: deposited amount must equal Task 3's final Toyota amount, otherwise a Mismatch Reason is required (same mechanism). Bank + transaction number unique within the Task 5 space (separate from Task 4).
- Task 6: four invoices, each with number (`SERIES-CORRELATIVE`, Proposal pattern: 4 alphanumeric characters, a hyphen, 1 to 8 digits), date, amount and PDF. Each amount must match its expected value exactly or carry a Mismatch Reason. Invoice numbers are globally unique, including cancelled sales.
- Task 8: DAM number unique; customs office from the controlled list (Marítima del Callao, Chancay); control channel Verde / Naranja / Rojo.
- Task 10: license plate unique among `active` and `completed` sales.
- Dates: impossible values are hard-blocked; out-of-order dates produce a warning only.
- No tax (IGV) logic anywhere; amounts are compared exactly.

### 2.4 Financial source fields

These fields feed calculations or checks in later tasks. Once any later task is completed they are locked, and the Manager or Admin must roll back in reverse order (T3 repeatedly) before correcting them:

- Task 1: the four amounts and the quoted final price.
- Task 3: the final Toyota amount and the final commission.

All other fields of a completed task (including documents) can be edited with a Reason for Edit.

## 3. Sale state machine

States: `active`, `completed`, `cancelled`. Sale-level data is immutable after creation except notes and the assigned advisor.

**Cancellation rule.** Let _c_ be the number of the current task.

- Assigned Advisor may cancel while _c_ is 1 to 3.
- Manager may cancel while _c_ is 1 to 6.
- Admin may cancel any `active` sale, and is the only one who can cancel once Task 6 is completed.

**Reopen rule.** Manager or Admin may reopen a sale that was cancelled while _c_ was 1 to 6. Only an Admin may reopen a sale that was cancelled after Task 6 was completed. Advisors can never reopen.

## 4. Milestones (derived, never stored)

| Milestone                     | Tasks |
| ----------------------------- | ----- |
| 1. Cotización y Documentación | 1–2   |
| 2. Asignación y Pago          | 3–4   |
| 3. Facturación Oficial        | 5–6   |
| 4. Trámites Aduaneros         | 7–8   |
| 5. Liberación y Placas        | 9–10  |
| 6. Preparación y Entrega      | 11–13 |

A milestone is `completed` when all its tasks are completed; `in_progress` when it contains the current task and is not completed; `pending` otherwise. When all 13 tasks are completed, all six milestones are `completed` and there is no current task. The overall sale state (`active` / `completed` / `cancelled`) is always shown separately; for a cancelled sale the milestones show the state frozen at cancellation. One shared derivation (a database view or query) serves the customer portal, employee filters and BI.

**Customer visibility.** Customers see only fields and documents marked customer-visible, and only from **completed** tasks. When a task is reopened or restarted its data disappears from the portal and the milestone moves back honestly. Sale creation data (vehicle, advisor business email and phone, creation date) is visible from the start.

## 5. SLA, reminders and escalation

### 5.1 Durations

| Task                        | Duration | Reminder interval |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 2 Debida Diligencia         | 3 days   | 12 hours          |
| 3 Liquidación de Unidad     | 12 days  | 24 hours          |
| 7 Documentos Endosados      | 10 days  | 24 hours          |
| 8 Trámite Aduanero          | 12 days  | 24 hours          |
| 9 Trámite de Liberación     | 30 days  | 48 hours          |
| 10 Inmatriculación y Placas | 15 days  | 24 hours          |

All other tasks have no duration, no SLA and `completion_phase` = `not_applicable` (excluded from SLA averages). Durations are elapsed calendar time; weekends do not pause the clock. A new duration outside these ranges requires an explicit policy.

### 5.2 Timeline of one SLA interval

1. T1 start: `due_date` = `started_at` + duration.
2. At 80% of the duration: one **Approaching** warning to the assigned Advisor.
3. After `due_date`, at the first hourly evaluation: **overdue reminder 1**.
4. Then one reminder per interval (section 5.1) up to a cap of **6** overdue reminders.
5. After the cap: no more emails, UI highlight only.

### 5.3 Escalation by reminder count

| Reminder    | To                  | Copied                          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 80% warning | Assigned Advisor    | none                            |
| 1           | Assigned Advisor    | none                            |
| 2–3         | All active Managers | Advisor                         |
| 4–6         | All active Admins   | Advisor and all active Managers |

If a level has no active recipient, the attempt is logged as failed with that reason and the next level is not skipped. No overdue state ever unlocks or reassigns a task.

### 5.4 What resets and what resumes

| Event                        | `due_date`                                                                               | Reminder counters and phase |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reopen a completed task (T3) | Preserved                                                                                | Kept (cap not re-armed)     |
| Restart (T4, then T1)        | Recalculated from the new `started_at`                                                   | Reset                       |
| Sale cancelled               | Reminders stop immediately                                                               | Frozen                      |
| Cancelled sale reopened (S5) | Shifted forward by the time spent cancelled (equivalent to resuming with remaining time) | Kept                        |

### 5.5 `completion_phase`

Let D = duration and _elapsed_ = `completed_at` − `started_at`.

- `early`: elapsed < 80% of D.
- `in_approaching`: 80% of D ≤ elapsed ≤ D.
- `overdue`: D < elapsed < D + one reminder interval.
- `recurring_overdue`: elapsed ≥ D + one reminder interval.
- `not_applicable`: task has no duration.

It is recalculated every time the task is completed, using the preserved `due_date` after a reopen.

### 5.6 Scheduler behavior

- Hourly trigger, authenticated with a secret, rate-limited, and answering quickly.
- Evaluation is stateless and idempotent: it claims a task's reminder in the database before sending, so overlapping runs never double-send.
- A reminder is due when `last_reminder_sent_at` + interval is reached, with a few minutes of tolerance so scheduler jitter cannot skip a cycle.
- Reminders to deactivated employees are skipped.

## 6. Customer notifications (idempotent per sale + event)

A successfully sent milestone notification is never re-sent when a task is reverted and completed again. Failed attempts may be retried under a defined policy. Employees get activation links by email at their business address.

## 7. Role × action permission matrix

"Own" means sales where the user is the **current** `assigned_advisor_id`. Access never derives from `created_by`. Every cell is enforced on the backend.

### 7.1 Staff, catalog and customers

Every export, permanent deletion, role change, reassignment, cancellation, reopening and document change writes an audit event. Access logs stay separate from the business audit log.

## 8. Items to confirm

1. Customer sees cancelled sales as _Cancelada_ without reason and without an email (Proposal in section 3).
2. Only `active` sales can be reassigned (Proposal in S6).
3. Task 4 and Task 5 deposited amounts also lock once Task 6 is completed (Proposal in 2.4).
4. The `completion_phase` boundaries in 5.5.
5. Reminder emails run around the clock; should there be quiet hours (Lima time)?
6. Advisors can edit only sale notes after creation; everything else on the sale is immutable or Manager/Admin-only.
7. Vehicle model, version and color are strictly immutable after creation, with cancel-and-recreate as the correction path (my choice, as you delegated); the advisor-cancel window (Task 1 to 3) fits this.
