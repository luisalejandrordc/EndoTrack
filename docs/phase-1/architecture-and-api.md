# EndosoFlow — Architecture & API Contract

## 1. Status and how to read

This document proposes how the application is built: the backend layers and modules, the **project structure**, the technical choices behind it, the API conventions and the Phase 1 API surface. It builds on the State Machines & Permissions Spec, Requirements Catalog, IA & Journeys and Data Model.

## 2. Architecture in one page

A **modular monolith**: one Go service, one deployable, internally divided into modules with clear boundaries. For a small team and a free-tier host this is simpler, cheaper and easier to test than microservices, and the module boundaries keep a later split possible.

Each module follows the same five layers, and dependencies point inward:

1. **Transport** (HTTP): the Chi router, middleware, request and response shapes, and the mapping of errors to HTTP responses. No business rules.
2. **Application services:** one method per use case. A service opens a database transaction, checks authorization, orchestrates the other layers and writes audit and outbox rows.
3. **Domain:** pure Go code with no input or output: the task and sale state machines, SLA calculations, milestone derivation, validators (identifier formats, formulas) and the authorization policy tables. This is where most unit tests live.
4. **Data access:** type-safe SQL written by hand and turned into Go code by `sqlc`, wrapped in thin repositories. Queries take the acting user’s scope, so out-of-scope rows never leave the database.
5. **Adapters** behind small interfaces: object storage (R2), email sender (Apps Script), identity lookup (Codart), clock and id generator. Tests replace them with fakes.

The rule that keeps this healthy: the domain imports nothing from the other layers, and services depend on interfaces, never on a vendor SDK.

Services call the domain for decisions and data access for persistence; the transport layer only ever talks to services.

## 3. Backend modules

| Module          | Owns (tables)                                                                | Responsibilities                                                                                    | Depends on                                                |

A module never reads another module’s tables directly; it calls that module’s service. The exceptions are the read-only `search` queries and the shared milestone view.

## 4. Proposed project structure

One repository (monorepo) named `grupo-pana-endoso`:

```

Inside each backend module the same small set of files repeats, so any module is easy to read once you know one:

- `handler.go`: HTTP handlers and request or response mapping.
- `service.go`: the use cases and transaction boundaries.
- `policy.go`: who may do what (the permission matrix as code).
- `domain/`: pure rules and types, with tests.
- `repository.go`: wrappers over the generated query code.
- `*_test.go`: tests next to the code.

## 6. Request pipeline and security

Every request passes the same steps in order:

1. Assign a request id and recover from panics.
2. Log the request (method, path, status, duration, request id; no bodies).
3. Apply security headers and rate limits (stricter on login and lookup endpoints).
4. Verify the access token (signature and expiry).
5. Load the employee and check, in the database, that the account is active and the role matches the token (confirmed rule).
6. Run the endpoint’s authorization policy (default deny).
7. Call the handler, which calls one service method inside one transaction.
8. Map errors to the standard error shape.

**Cookies and CSRF.** The refresh token travels only in an HttpOnly, Secure cookie scoped to the auth path. Because the frontend reaches the API through the same-origin `/api` proxy, the cookie can use `SameSite=Strict`. Refresh and logout also require a custom request header and an origin check as a second defence. The access token stays in memory; on a 401 the client refreshes once and retries.

**Authorization as code.** Each module’s `policy.go` mirrors the permission matrix: a function that takes the actor, the action and the resource facts and answers allow or deny. Repository queries also take the actor’s scope (for example the advisor id), so an advisor asking for another advisor’s sale gets ‘not found’, never ‘forbidden’, and nothing leaks. The authorization tests are generated from the matrix, one case per role and action.

## 7. Transactions, concurrency and side effects

- **One use case, one transaction.** Anything that changes a sale first takes a row lock on that sale (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), which serializes concurrent transitions.
- **Optimistic locking.** Editable resources return a `version` (the row version). Updates must send the version they read; a mismatch returns a 409 ‘modified by someone else’ response and the client reloads.
- **Repeat safety without idempotency keys.** Transition endpoints (start, complete, restart, reopen) state the expected current status. A double click finds the status already changed and returns a clean conflict, so the transition applies once.
- **Outbox pattern for side effects.** Emails and stored-file deletions are written as rows (`notification_logs`, `storage_deletions`) inside the same transaction as the business change. After the commit, the backend processes them; the hourly job retries what failed. If the process dies, nothing is lost and nothing is sent twice (unique dedupe keys).
- **Audit in the same transaction.** The audit row is written with the change, so a change without its audit entry cannot commit.

## 8. API conventions

- **Base path and versioning:** `/api/v1`, JSON over HTTPS, one resource style across modules.
- **Naming:** camelCase fields (P); identifiers are UUID strings; timestamps are ISO 8601 in UTC; calendar dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Money:** a string with two decimals, for example `"1250.50"`, never a floating-point number.
- **Lists:** `page` and `pageSize` (default 20, maximum 100) with a total count, `sort` (for example `-createdAt`) and plain filter parameters. Offset paging is enough at this scale and supports jumping to a page.
- **Status codes:** 200 and 201 for success; 400 for malformed requests; 401 for no or expired credentials; 403 when the record is visible but the action is not allowed; 404 for missing or out-of-scope records; 409 for version, state and uniqueness conflicts; 422 for rule violations; 429 for rate limits.
- **Error shape:**

```
{ "error": { "code": "TASK_FINANCIAL_FIELD_LOCKED",
    "message": "Bloqueado: hay tareas posteriores completadas.",
    "fields": [ { "field": "accessoryAmount", "code": "LOCKED", "message": "..." } ],
    "requestId": "..." } }
```

Codes are stable English constants; messages are Spanish and safe to show. The error catalog (about 40 codes, grouped by module) is part of the OpenAPI file.

- **Warnings:** successful saves may return `warnings` (for example an out-of-order date) that never block.
- **Task data:** one endpoint per task, with a payload schema per task number; the response returns the saved data, calculated values (quoted price, final commission, expected amounts) and warnings.
- **Reference data:** the interface asks `/reference` once for enums, Spanish labels, definitions and document slots, so labels are never hard-coded twice.
- **Uploads:** `multipart/form-data`, streamed to storage; size and type are checked before and after.

## 9. Phase 1 API surface

All paths are under `/api/v1`. “Any staff” means Admin, Manager and Advisor; every sale or customer route is further limited by scope.

Phase 3 adds the scheduler endpoints (authenticated with a secret, not a user), BI, exports and the log viewers; Phase 2 adds the customer portal routes under a separate path prefix.

## 10. Quality, environments and delivery

**Tests (Phase 1).**

- Domain: table-driven unit tests for every state-machine transition, SLA calculation and validator.
- Integration: each row of the Data Model’s rule map is tested against a real PostgreSQL, including the negative cases (a second in-progress task, a duplicate invoice number, a color from another model).
- API: the authorization matrix, one test per role and action, plus the error shapes.
- End to end (Playwright): the journeys J1 to J9 from the IA document.

**Environments.** Local (PostgreSQL installed locally with Homebrew on Mac or with the apt package manager on Ubuntu), then one deployed environment on the free tiers. A separate production environment is created when you decide to leave the free tier. Non-production environments send emails only to an allow-list.

**Delivery.** Short-lived branches into `main`; every pull request runs lint, tests (the CI runner provides its own temporary PostgreSQL), build, a migration check and an OpenAPI compatibility check; merging to `main` deploys automatically. Migrations are forward-only SQL; a bad migration is fixed with a new one.
