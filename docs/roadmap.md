# EndosoFlow — Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Discovery and platform validation

Define the business rules, answer the open questions, define the tech stack, resolve possible edge-cases, build the glossary and decision log, and deliver the State Machine & Permissions Spec. It also produces the MVP / V1 / future split.

- **MVP:** employee and customer sign-in with activation links, customers, vehicle catalog, sale creation, the 13-task workflow with documents, cancel and reopen, basic history, the customer portal with milestones and customer-visible documents, and the first two customer emails.
- **V1:** the remaining emails, SLA reminders and escalation, BI dashboard, raw exports, audit and access-log viewers, all catalog viewpoints, hardening.
- **Future:** PDF reports, backups and recovery automation, malware scanning, a custom domain, swapping Apps Script for Resend, an in-portal notification center, i18n.
- **Out of scope:** installments, other currencies, parallel tasks, multi-vehicle sales.
